# Senior Design Project Imported from bitbucket
This project is designed to be a Front end and Middle Tier application to interface with our c++ backend which we have as a private repo in bitbucket and was developed by Brian McClelland.
<p>
    Back end is built from Arcaic (php framework) in my Repo. The front end developers used the Javascript JQuery library.
